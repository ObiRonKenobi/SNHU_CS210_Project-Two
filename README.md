# SNHU_CS210_Project-Two
AIRGEAD BANKING app


# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The purpose of this project was to develop secure and efficient object-oreinted code that calculate the amount of money in a savings account given a a user entered interest rate, a user entered number of years, and with/without a user entered monthly deposit.


# What did you do particularly well?
  I was particularly pleased with my use of systme("cls") to keep the output window clear and focused. I also think my menu and data output formatting was adequate. My use of _getch() to pause outputs awaiting a user entered keystroke seemed appropriate as well.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  My grade was 100% for this project so I assume it adequately met all the rubric requirements in terms of encapsulation and security. In the future, i believe i could have broken a few more of the callable functions into other classes to reduce the amount of code in main().

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  Seperating the classes into seperate header and source files was a bit challenging at first but i found a good example of what this should look like in section 7.8 of our zyBooks material and using this as a reference was crucial to correctly execute this part of the project.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  The seperation of classes into other files was a big learning experience here and i believe it will be very transferrable moving forward. While it was tricky at first, once i understood what i was doing i began to view the code more like legos that each had theis individual uses and benefits that code be snapped together and used to build a functional and well-executed program.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  The encapsulation of different functions into classes that were themselves split into different file increases mainntainability, readability and adapability because it makes it clear what each portion of the code does and where to find it. further if one piece of the code needs to be changed it is clear what file should be addressed and how that file is called and read in the main() source file.
